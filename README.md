# next.ts 13 app boilerplate #
## Project description
This boilerplate includes a template for eslint and stylelint this will help your code to stay clean and readable. We also choose to use SASS with BEM methodology, you can learn more below.

Like the name says this is boilerplate, fell free to improve but please keep the basics so we can keep similarity on all projects.

## Prerequisites
* node, we recommend using at least node v16
* yarn


### To start

```
yarn
yarn dev
```
### Update

```
yarn update
```

We all like to work on updated stuff so we recommend running the following command when setup the project

### Linting

```
yarn lint
```

Don't forget, before each commit check the linting, but don't worry husky will alert you if you forget. Yarn lint will run eslint and stylelint, and try to fix the issues it finds, but some stuff you need to fix manually.
